        <h2 class="section-title">TYPES OF EVENTS</h2>
        
        <div class="event-types">
            <div class="event-item">
                <strong>1. Simple Event:</strong> Also known as an elementary event, a simple event is an event that consists of exactly one outcome. For example, when rolling a fair six-sided die, getting a 3 is a simple event.
            </div>
            
            <div class="event-item">
                <strong>2. Compound Event:</strong> A compound event consists of two or more simple events. For example, when rolling a die, the event "rolling an odd number" is a compound event because it consists of three simple events: rolling a 1, rolling a 3, or rolling a 5.
            </div>
            
            <div class="event-item">
                <strong>3. Independent Events:</strong> Two events are independent if the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the occurrence of the other event. For example, if you flip a coin and roll a die, the outcome of the coin flip does not affect the outcome of the die roll.
            </div>
            
            <div class="event-item">
                <strong>4. Dependent Events:</strong> Events are dependent if the occurrence of one event does affect the probability of the occurrence of the other event. For example, if you draw two cards from a deck without replacement, the outcome of the first draw affects the outcome of the second draw because there are fewer cards left in the deck.
            </div>
            
            <div class="event-item">
                <strong>5. Mutually Exclusive Events:</strong> Two events are mutually exclusive (or disjoint) if they cannot both occur at the same time. For example, when rolling a die, the events "roll a 2" and "roll a 4" are mutually exclusive because a single roll of the die cannot result in both a 2 and a 4.
            </div>
            
            <div class="event-item">
                <strong>6. Exhaustive Events:</strong> A set of events is exhaustive if at least one of the events must occur when the experiment is performed. For example, when rolling a die, the events "roll an even number" and "roll an odd number" are exhaustive because one or the other must occur on any roll.

                    <li>The intuition behind the formula for conditional probability, P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), is based on the concept of reducing our sample space.</li>
                    <li>The denominator, P(B), is the probability of event B occurring. When we say we want to know the probability of A given B, we're effectively saying that B has occurred and therefore B is our new "universe" or sample space. So we're not considering cases when B didn't occur anymore, and we're normalizing by the probability of B.</li>
                    <li>The numerator, P(A ∩ B), is the joint probability of A and B, meaning both A and B occur. So in the context of our new universe where B has occurred, P(A ∩ B) represents the cases where A also occurs.</li>
                    <li>By dividing the joint probability P(A ∩ B) by the probability of B (P(B)), we effectively find the proportion of times that A occurs given that B has occurred.</li>
                    <li>In summary, the conditional probability of A given B is just the joint probability of A and B happening (A and B together in the "universe" where everything happens), normalized by the probability of B (the new "universe" where only B happens).</li>
